# OASIS INFOBYTE INTERN MAY 2023

Embarking on an internship is not just about gaining professional experience; itâ€™s a transformative journey that shapes your skills, expands your knowledge, and sets you on a path toward personal and career growth.

# LEVEL 2 - TASK1 (Calulator)

It takes a little skill to create a calculator with basic
mathematical functionalities using CSS, HTML, and
JavaScript. Calculators require an interactive interface to
perform basic functions such as addition, subtraction,
division, and multiplication. It will need a display screen to
display the user's input and give the results. The grid system
in CSS is for the alignment of buttons on the calculator.
The additional tools you need to build a fully functional
calculator include event listeners, if-else statements, operators, loops, and so on.
